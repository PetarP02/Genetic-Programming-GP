# Genetic-Programming-GP

This program implements a genetic programming algorithm aimed at discovering a mathematical expression that closely approximates a specified target value (goal). 
The algorithm works by evolving a population of genomes, where each genome represents a mathematical expression structured as a binary tree of operations and operands.
